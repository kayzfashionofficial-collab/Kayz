        </p>

        <h2>Eligibility for Returns</h2>
        <p>
          To be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition
          that you received it — unworn or unused, with tags, and in its
          original packaging. You’ll also need the receipt or proof of purchase.
        </p>
        <p>
          To start a return, contact us at{" "}

          If your return is accepted, we’ll send you a return shipping label,
          along with detailed instructions on how and where to send your
          package. <strong>Items sent back to us without requesting a return</strong>{" "}
          will not be accepted.

        <h2>Damages and Issues</h2>
        <p>
          Please inspect your order upon reception and contact us immediately if
          the item is defective, damaged, or if you receive the wrong item, so
          that we can evaluate the issue and make it right.
        </p>

        <h2>Exceptions / Non-Returnable Items</h2>
        <p>
          Certain types of items cannot be returned, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Perishable goods (such as food, flowers, or plants)</li>
          <li>Custom or personalized products</li>
          <li>Personal care goods (such as beauty or hygiene products)</li>

        <p>
          Unfortunately, we cannot accept returns on <strong>sale items</strong>{" "}
          or <strong>gift cards</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>Exchanges</h2>
        <p>
          The fastest way to ensure you get what you want is to return the item
          you have. Once the return is accepted, make a separate purchase for
          the new item.
        </p>

          We will notify you once we’ve received and inspected your return, and
          let you know if the refund is approved or not. If approved, you’ll be
